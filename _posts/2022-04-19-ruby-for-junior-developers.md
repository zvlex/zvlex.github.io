**Ruby for Junior Developers** - is a short introduction course based on my knowledge and experience for people, who wants to learn [Ruby][ruby-lang] programming language from scratch.

To begin only a basic knowledge of Unix/Linux is required.

> In this course, I use Fedora Linux Workstation. You can download it from [here][fedora].


Have a nice journey!

**Ruby** - a dynamic, general-purpose programming language with elegant syntax, mostly used to build complex web applications.

Was born in Japan in 1995 and quickly gained popularity there, but due to the lack of translation of documentation into English, only a couple of years later he got out of the country.

Its creator, [Yukihiro Matsumoto][matz], or as he calls himself [Matz][matz_rb], originally created a language aimed primarily at people, not machines. In his opinion, the developer, instead of struggling with the design of the language, once again trying to get around the limitations, should enjoy the development and be productive.

> In 2016, Ruby ranked first in [Tiobe's][tiobe] programming language rankings.

The language didn't experience much popularity in the world until [David Heinemeier Hansson][dhh] (DHH) released a web development framework called [Ruby on Rails][rails] in 2005. 

At that time, the super innovative framework gave a new impetus to the development of Ruby, and some technical decisions also influenced other web frameworks.

As a result, a successful framework determined the future of the Ruby language and the niche it occupied.

> This is not the only place where the language is used, it is also used in other areas, for example, in the field of security auditing, the [Metasploit framework][metasploit], the [YaST][yast] operating system configuration utility is written in Ruby, in the field of IoT ([mruby][mruby]), [DragonRuby Game Toolkit][dragon-ruby], and many others. But mostly the language is used in web development.


Ruby is actively developed, new versions are released every year, and the third version of the language was recently released.

Now in **2022**, it is **still relevant**.
